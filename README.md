# Strings

Strings are a fundamental data-type. Knowing the string manipulation techniques available in your language will serve you well during whiteboarding interviews. Here are a list of patterns you can practice and memorize in your language:

#
- [ ] Iterating through characters in a string, with and without keeping track of the index
- [ ] Slicing strings given a start and an end index
- [ ] Finding the index of a target character
- [ ] Getting all possible substrings of certain length
- [ ] Getting all possible sets of pairs and triples
- [ ] Getting the counts of each character in a string
- [ ] How to make a function case-sensitive and case-insensitive


The more quickly you can memorize patterns for string manipulation, the more capacity you will have for problem solving!
