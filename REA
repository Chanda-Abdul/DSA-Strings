Strings are a fundamental data-type. Knowing the string manipulation techniques available in your language will serve you well during whiteboarding interviews. Here are a list of patterns you can practice and memorize in your language:

-[] Iterating through characters in a string, with and without keeping track of the index
-[] Slicing strings given a start and an end index
-[] Finding the index of a target character
-[] Getting all possible substrings of certain length
-[] Getting all possible sets of pairs and triples
-[] Getting the counts of each character in a string
-[] How to make a function case-sensitive and case-insensitive


The more quickly you can memorize patterns for string manipulation, the more capacity you will have for problem solving!
